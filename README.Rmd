# volleyxml

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raymondben/volleyxml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/raymondben/volleyxml)

An R package for reading volleyball scouting files in XML format.

See also the [datavolley R package](https://github.com/raymondben/datavolley) for DataVolley files. Note that the data structures and conventions returned by `volleyxml` have been chosen to be similar (partly compatible) with those of the `datavolley` package.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("raymondben/volleyxml")
```

## Example

Read the example data file bundled with the package:
```{r}
library(volleyxml)
x <- vx_read(vx_example_file())
summary(x)
```
